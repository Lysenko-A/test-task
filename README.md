### Notes

For this application I used [Mantine template](https://mantine.dev/guides/next/).
Forms and form validation were made with help of this library.
I added the "Sign in with Google or Credentials" feature and skipped the rest also I added a logout button for testing.

An image for the testimonials was taken from Figma, as no other images were provided.

About design, the size of some elements were changed due to the good look and readability on the mobile devices.
