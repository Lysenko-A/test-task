### Notes

For this application I used [Mantine template](https://mantine.dev/guides/next/).
Forms and form validation were made with help of this library.

An image for the testimonials was taken from Figma, as no other images were provided.

The task didn't specify full flow of the login processes. So for the test task I went with the easiest way - using local storage.

About design, the size of some elements were changed due to the good look and readability on the mobile devices.
